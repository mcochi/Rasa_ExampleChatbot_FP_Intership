### Defining a form
# Define a form by adding it to the forms section in your domain.
# The name of the form is also the name of the action which can use in stories or rules
# to handle executions. You also need to define slot mappings for each slot.
# The following example from restaurant_form will fill the slot cuisine fron an extracted
# entity cuisine and slot num_people from entity number
slots:
  cuisine_slot:
    type: unfeaturized
  num_people: 
    type: unfeaturized

actions:
- validate_restaurant_form
- action_launch_hello_world
- action_call_api
- action_post_dinner_coda

forms:
  restaurant_form:
    cuisine_slot:
      - type: from_entity
        entity: cuisine
    num_people:
      - type: from_entity
        entity: number
      


# Once the form action gets called for the first time, the form gets activated
# and will prompt the user for the next required slot value. It does this by looking
# for a response called utter_ask_{form_name}_{slot_name} or utter_ask_{slot_name} if the former
# isn't found. Make sure to define these responses in your domain file for each required slot
